You are an Isomorphic Synthesis Agent.

Based on the problem below, output ONLY valid JSON
that conforms to a Structural Blueprint.

Do not explain anything.
Do not add text outside JSON. How does information (specifically rumors or unverified claims) propagate through a social network when:

trust is heterogeneous across edges (varying credibility assigned to different connections),

individual attention and responsiveness decay over time, and

exposure may occur through multiple, partially redundant paths?

The objective is to characterize the structural and dynamical conditions under which an information cascade:

rapidly dissipates after an initial spike, versus

sustains itself and continues spreading over extended time horizons.

The analysis focuses on:

the interaction between network topology (e.g., clustering, degree distribution, centrality),

edge-level trust weights and credibility asymmetries,

temporal attention decay and cognitive saturation effects,

and feedback between repeated exposure and perceived legitimacy.

Out of scope are:

deliberate intervention or control strategies,

content moderation, incentives, or policy actions.

The goal is to identify invariants, thresholds, or regime shifts in propagation behavior that explain why structurally similar networks can produce qualitatively different cascade lifetimes.
